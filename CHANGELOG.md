# Changelog

All notable changes to the `ai-research-skills` catalog (the registry
+ docs repo at `WenyuChiou/ai-research-skills`). The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Scope.** This CHANGELOG covers the catalog itself — `marketplace.json`,
> `catalog/skills.yml`, this repo's docs, tests, and scripts. Each
> plugin's source repo keeps its own changelog for SKILL.md content,
> reference files, and per-plugin behaviour. Upstream changes are
> picked up automatically because `marketplace.json` currently uses
> `ref: <default-branch>` for every plugin (pinning is on the roadmap,
> see [`docs/design-philosophy.md`](docs/design-philosophy.md)).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.22] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **README §4 `### Already use Zotero / Obsidian / NotebookLM?`
  callout** — surfaces `research-hub`'s library-management integration
  loop as its own subsection in §4 (between the trigger table and the
  `All 15 skills` `<details>` blocks). Previously this integration story
  lived in a single line buried inside the 11-skill bullet list
  (`research-hub — search, ingest, organise papers across Zotero /
  Obsidian / NotebookLM`); readers arriving from the 1.5.20 promo cycle
  (which calls out the 4-tool loop explicitly) had no matching §-level
  landing point. The callout addresses three things in one block:
  - **What the loop is** — *search new literature (arXiv, Semantic
    Scholar) → Zotero metadata + ingest → per-paper notes synced to
    Obsidian → NotebookLM briefs verified against source bundles.*
  - **Optionality (critical correction)** — all three tools (Zotero,
    Obsidian, NotebookLM) are **optional**; `research-hub` adapts to
    whichever subset the user has connected, or runs in sample-dashboard
    mode with none. The previous bullet-list line implied the
    integration required all three.
  - **Skill route vs MCP route distinction** — the integration runs on
    the `research-hub` Python CLI (`pip install research-hub-pipeline`),
    not on third-party MCP servers. Independent MCP servers
    (`paper-search-mcp`, Zotero / NotebookLM MCPs) coexist for readers
    who already use them: skills orchestrate workflows, MCPs give raw
    tool access. The `research-hub` CLI itself also exposes an MCP
    interface (`research-hub serve`) for hosts that prefer MCP
    integration; this is one tool, two interfaces.
  - Closes with a direct link to the
    [research-hub project README](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/research-hub)
    so a reader who wants tool-by-tool setup detail lands on the source
    repo's own onboarding, not on a SKILL.md sub-page.
- **`README.zh-TW.md` mirror** — Traditional Chinese version of the
  same callout. All technical terms (`research-hub`, MCP server names,
  `paper-search-mcp`, `research-hub serve`, `pip install
  research-hub-pipeline`, sample-dashboard mode) preserved verbatim in
  English per locale convention; surrounding narrative translated.

### Changed

- **`research-hub` in §4 `All 15 skills` `<details>` summary header is
  now a hyperlink** to the project root
  (`https://github.com/WenyuChiou/research-hub`). Previously the term
  was a `<code>` span with no `<a>` wrapper; the 11 skill bullets
  inside the `<details>` block link to per-skill SKILL.md sub-pages,
  but the project root (which renders the upstream README with full
  setup + end-to-end demos + MCP integration docs) had no surfaced
  link path from the catalog README outside the collapsed clone block
  in §1. Now a reader hovering on the section header for "11 skills
  from research-hub" can one-click into the project itself, not just
  the sub-pages. Same change applied to `README.zh-TW.md`.

## [1.5.21] - 2026-05-23

### Changed

- **README §5 "See what each skill produces" — bullet list → direct-link
  table.** Previously the section was 7 descriptive bullets pointing at a
  single `docs/examples.md` link; readers wanting to *see* the actual
  artifact (a topic dossier, a design brief, a project manifest, a
  claims roster) had to click `docs/examples.md`, scroll to the relevant
  section, then click again. Two clicks of friction per artifact, on
  the section that exists specifically to lower friction. With 1.5.20's
  promo cycle calling out the four named deliverables (gap decision
  table / design brief / project manifest / paper claim roster), the
  landing path from a Threads / X post → repo → §5 → actual artifact
  needs to be one click, not three.
  - **`README.md` §5 restructured into a 6-row table** with three
    columns: Stage / What the skill produces / Example file. Every
    bullet now resolves to a direct link to the artifact file in
    `docs/` (`example-literature-review-deliverable.md`,
    `example-topic-dossier.md` + `.gaps.yml`, `example-design-brief.md`,
    `example-project-manifest.yml`, `example-design-to-build.md`,
    `example-paper-memory-claims.yml` + `figures.yml`). The descriptive
    text per row carries the *schema feature* that makes the artifact
    distinctive — the 3-gate decision (open / contribution /
    feasibility) for Stage 2; the Socratic-walked five-segment shape
    for Stage 3a; `provenance.from_gap` for Stage 3b; the `status: gap`
    anti-leakage rule for Stage 7. A reader can now scan the table,
    pick the artifact closest to what they care about, and land on it
    in one click. The narrative tour link at the bottom
    (`docs/examples.md`) is preserved for readers who want the per-skill
    input/output context.
  - **`README.zh-TW.md` §5 mirrored** with the same 6-row table
    structure. All 8 example file paths are byte-identical to EN (no
    `.zh-TW` variants exist for example YAMLs); the descriptive column
    is translated to Traditional Chinese with technical terms
    (`provenance.from_gap`, `status: gap`, `anti-leakage`, sentinel,
    Socratic) preserved verbatim per the locale convention.

### Fixed

- **README §5 click-depth** for the four named deliverables emphasised
  in the 1.5.20 promotional copy. The bullet→table change cuts two
  clicks of friction per artifact, aligning the README's actual click
  path with the promo copy's implicit promise that the deliverables
  are *seeable*, not just *describable*.

## [1.5.20] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **`docs/img/pipeline-overview.png`** regenerated from the existing
  `docs/img/pipeline-overview-prompt.md` English prompt block.
  Replaces the 2026-05-12 PNG which had drifted: previous subtitle
  read *"14 AI skills"* (now 15), bottom badge read *"14 skills total
  / 10 from research-hub"* (now 15 / 11), Stage 2 chip row had 4
  chips missing `gap-to-topic` (now 5 chips with `gap-to-topic`
  inserted between `literature-triage-matrix` and `research-hub`).
  All other stage chips, the cross-cutting band, icon styles, fonts,
  color palette, and dotted-line routing preserved verbatim per the
  reference-image + diff regeneration approach documented in the
  prompt file's *Known iteration pitfalls* block.
- **`docs/img/pipeline-overview.zh-TW.png`** regenerated with the
  same 4 fixes plus the Taiwan-localized stage-title labels (chip
  names stay in English per the convention).
- **`docs/img/social-preview.png`** regenerated for the GitHub
  Open-Graph card. Replaces the previous *"13 AI skills for the full
  research workflow"* subtitle (drift) with *"15 AI skills for the
  full research workflow"* (the count `15` rendered in teal #2DA89C
  for visual emphasis), and replaces the 6-stage simplified pipeline
  chain (*Discover → Plan → Build → Validate → Write → Submit*) with
  the 8-stage chain matching the new README §3 narrative
  (*Discover → Find the Gap → Frame → Plan → Build → Run → Visualise
  → Submit*). 8 glyph icons (magnifying glass / table grid /
  light bulb / checklist / wrench / gauge / chart / paper plane)
  connected by thin teal arrows. Left-third title block (`AI` glyph,
  *"AI Research Skills"* title, repo URL footer) preserved.
- **GitHub repo About widget refreshed** (set via `gh repo edit` —
  this is a network-state change visible immediately on the repo
  page, not a file change in this PR but recorded here for
  traceability): description rewritten from *"14 Claude Code skills
  for common research tasks…"* to *"15 Claude Code skills that fix
  five research pain points: state loss across AI sessions,
  hallucinated citations, vague gap analysis, AI-smell prose,
  cross-AI handoff. 5-plugin marketplace, one install."* (aligned
  with the new pain-first README §2). Added three topics:
  `agentic-ai`, `research-workflow`, `multi-agent` (10 existing
  topics retained).

### Changed

- **`README.md` restructured into a 7-section pain-first narrative.** The
  previous `What is this → Install → How to use → Pick by goal → All 15
  skills` flow organised the catalog around its surface area (5 plugins ×
  N skills) rather than what readers actually want to know (what pain
  does this fix? how do I install? what's the workflow?). Three views
  of the same skill list (auto-trigger / goal / source-repo) competed
  without a single load-bearing **pipeline-as-workflow** narrative
  carrying the catalog's identity. The 8-stage pipeline lived only in
  the rendered PNG and `docs/pipeline.md` — invisible to landing-page
  skimmers who read README body text. New structure:
  - **§1 Install — get the skills.** Promoted to first content section
    (was §3). Opens with a 30-second TL;DR (2-line install), then an
    explicit AI-paste hook ("Reading this in Claude / ChatGPT? Paste
    this whole §1 into your assistant and ask 'Install all 5 plugins
    for me and verify.'") so the install block is self-contained for
    AI-assisted onboarding. Keeps the additive 5-step block and `Verify`
    section. Adds a collapsed `<details>` "I'd rather clone the repo"
    block explaining that the catalog is a registry, not a monorepo
    (lists the 5 source repos).
  - **§2 Why this catalog exists.** Five pain points (P1–P5) named
    concretely — *"I keep re-explaining context"*, *"AI cites papers
    that don't exist"*, *"can't tell which gap is worth a thesis"*,
    *"AI-written prose smells like AI"*, *"switching Claude/Codex/
    Gemini wipes my state"* — followed by a three-principle architecture
    table (`Manifests` / `Schemas with anti-leakage` /
    `Character-driven routing`) that maps each principle to the pains
    it solves. Image embed `pipeline-overview.png` moves here from the
    top, so it lands at the moment the reader is being told *what the
    catalog is for*, not as decoration above the install commands.
  - **§3 The pipeline — what each stage delivers to the next.** A
    9-row table covering Stages 1, 2, 3a, 3b, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 with
    explicit `Output → next stage` columns naming the schema files
    (`topic_dossier.gaps.yml` → `design_brief.md` →
    `project_manifest.yml` → `.paper/claims.yml`). This is the
    **主線 (main line)** — a single load-bearing pipeline narrative
    that previous READMEs delegated entirely to `docs/pipeline.md`.
    Stage 4 explicitly labelled *cookbook* with the path-split rule
    (Claude direct ≤4 files, `codex-delegate` ≥5).
  - **§4 Use it.** Trigger table compressed from 8 rows to 4 (most
    distinctive use cases); the rest moved to
    [`docs/skill-directory.md`](docs/skill-directory.md). Keeps `All
    15 skills` collapsed `<details>` blocks (research-hub / standalone),
    time-cost table, and the Zotero CRUD backup warning.
  - **§5 See what each skill produces.** Pure pointer section — 7
    bullets, each linking to a worked example in
    [`docs/examples.md`](docs/examples.md). No inlined example
    content per the design rule that examples live in `docs/`, README
    only signposts.
  - **§6 Compatibility, §7 Limitations, License** — preserved
    unchanged.
- **"What this is" identity card.** A 6-line plain-text paragraph
  inserted between the language-switcher row and the badges row at
  the top of the README — names the catalog ("5 Claude Code plugins,
  15 skills"), the audience ("grad students, PhDs, postdocs, research
  support staff"), and the agentskills.io compliance + cross-runtime
  loadability in one place. This single block answers *"what am I
  looking at?"* before the reader reaches §1 Install.
- **`README.zh-TW.md` regenerated from scratch via `gemini-delegate`**
  to mirror the new EN structure section-by-section (7 sections + License),
  preserving all skill names, plugin names, file paths, YAML field
  names, YAML enum values, commands, URLs, and brand names in English
  per the locale convention. Stage names in §3 follow the canonical
  Taiwan-localized set (找文獻 / 整理比較、找 gap / 框問題 / 寫計畫 /
  設計與建模 / 執行、校正、驗證 / 視覺化與結果解讀 / 論文撰寫與修改 /
  投稿、回覆審查、收尾) matching the labels rendered in
  `pipeline-overview.zh-TW.png`. P1–P5 translated in natural Taiwan
  voice, not formal academic Chinese, matching the EN's direct
  pain-first register.

### Fixed

- **`docs/img/pipeline-overview.png` subtitle drift** (14 → 15 skills),
  bottom-badge counts (14 → 15 skills total, 10 → 11 from research-hub),
  and Stage 2 chip-row count (4 → 5, adding the missing
  `gap-to-topic` chip). Captured implicitly by the regeneration above
  but recorded here so a future drift-audit can see the deltas
  in one place.

## [1.5.19] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Stage 4 design-to-build cookbook published — fills the Stage 3a → 4
  handoff gap.** Stage 4 (*"Design and build the model"*) is intentionally
  not a dedicated skill in this catalog: its input is the Stage 3a
  `design_brief.md` and its output is **code in the operator's project
  repo** (prompt files, runnable scripts, analysis modules, a test
  harness), not a YAML manifest with a fixed schema. A skill-shaped
  abstraction would over-constrain that output. Until now the handoff
  was operator-glue without a worked example; this release adds a
  cookbook documenting it.
  - **`docs/example-design-to-build.md`** — A pedagogical cookbook
    that takes the existing `example-design-brief.md` (1.5.18) as its
    shared starting point and shows **two paths** for producing the
    Stage 4 scaffold:
    - **Path A — Claude-direct** (no codex): for scaffolds ≤ 4 files
      OR judgment-heavy work (architecture decisions, library picks,
      tight prompt-shape iteration). Uses Claude's `Write` / `Edit`
      tools in-conversation; acceptance is `python -m py_compile` +
      a mock-API smoke test + diff review.
    - **Path B — `codex-delegate`** (with codex): for scaffolds ≥ 5
      files AND a stable pattern (parameterised test skeletons,
      baseline variants, scripted directory layout). Includes a
      complete codex brief template (`.ai/codex_task_stage4_scaffold.md`
      shape) listing exact file paths and acceptance commands; the
      wrapper invocation; the `.result.json` inspection step; the
      mandatory `code-reviewer` gate per CLAUDE.md trigger #1
      (≥ 5 files).
    - Decision table mapping scaffold characteristics to the right
      path (file count, judgment density, pattern stability,
      mixed-work split rule).
    - Anti-patterns table covering the failure modes the cookbook
      prevents: skipping the brief re-read; sending Codex an
      open-ended scaffold prompt (F11 over-application risk);
      letting Codex implement business logic in the first pass;
      committing scaffold without a `code-reviewer` run; mixing
      scaffold and business-logic work in one commit.
- **`docs/examples.md`** — New `## Stage 4 — design brief to
  scaffolded code (cookbook, two paths)` section inserted between
  the Stage 7 section and the "Putting it together" section, with
  the same two-path decision table and a pointer into the full
  cookbook. Surfaces the cookbook from the catalog's main examples
  index so a researcher browsing the per-stage examples sees Stage
  4 has documented coverage even though the form is a cookbook
  rather than an artifact file.

### Changed

- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** — `metadata.version`
  `1.5.18 → 1.5.19`. No plugin version changes (documentation-only
  release).

## [1.5.18] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Three new catalog examples published — Stage 3a, Stage 3b, and
  Stage 7 outputs.** Prior catalog example coverage was uneven:
  `example-literature-review-deliverable.*` and `example-topic-dossier.*`
  covered Stages 1–2, but the planning and writing skills downstream of
  Stage 2 had no standalone example artifact. A reader who landed on
  the catalog without intending to run the full pipeline could not
  preview what `research-design-helper`, `research-context-compressor`,
  or `paper-memory-builder` actually produce. This release adds
  per-stage example artifacts so each skill's output is inspectable
  in isolation.
  - **`docs/example-design-brief.md`** — `research-design-helper`
    Stage 3a output for a `conditional-go` candidate carried over
    from the existing `example-topic-dossier.gaps.yml` (Candidate
    `G2`, socio-hydrology framing). The frontmatter shows three
    skill features simultaneously: `source` + `gap_verdict` for the
    v0.3.12+ provenance wire back to the dossier; `placeholder_segments:
    [2, 3, 4]` for the v0.3.15+ machine-flag that downstream tools
    use to refuse to gate real research on AI-generated stub content;
    and §0 auto-pre-fill in segments 1 and 5 contrasted with
    dialog-only segments 2-4.
  - **`docs/example-project-manifest.yml`** — `research-context-compressor`
    Stage 3b output that mirrors the design brief's sharpened research
    question into the manifest's `research_question` field and copies
    the design brief's `source` into `provenance.from_gap` (v0.3.12+
    wire registered in research-hub `docs/research-workspace-manifest.md`).
    Empty descriptive fields (`tools: []`, `datasets: []`) honour the
    compressor's "empty manifest field is better than an invented one"
    rule rather than fabricating context that the upstream brief
    does not warrant.
  - **`docs/example-paper-memory-claims.yml`** +
    **`docs/example-paper-memory-figures.yml`** —
    `paper-memory-builder` Stage 7 output illustrated against the
    publicly cited Kizilkaya et al. 2025 *Toward HydroLLM* paper
    (already in `example-topic-dossier.bib`; the cross-link lets a
    reader follow the same paper from the Stage 2 dossier through to
    its Stage 7 paper-memory). The claims file demonstrates the
    anti-leakage rule in action (claim C5 — a scope limitation the
    abstract alone cannot back — carries `status: gap` + a non-empty
    `gap_reason`); the figures file demonstrates the v0.3.16+
    `embedded-in-manuscript` `file:` sentinel. The claims are
    abstract-level because the example is built from the public
    abstract, not the full manuscript — a real
    `paper-memory-builder` run against the full paper would produce
    more granular Methods / Results claims with concrete figure
    paths.

- **`docs/examples.md` — three new sections.** One per new example
  family (`## research-design-helper — Stage 3a design brief`, `##
  research-context-compressor — Stage 3b project manifest`, `##
  paper-memory-builder — Stage 7 paper memory`), each showing the
  Input shape, Output schema-feature table, and cross-references to
  the upstream example artifacts. The sections are placed between
  the existing `## gap-to-topic` section and the closing
  `## Putting it together` synthesis paragraph, preserving the
  pipeline-stage ordering of the existing document.

- No `marketplace.json` plugin version changes — this release adds
  catalog-side documentation only; no upstream plugin code shipped.
  Catalog metadata version `1.5.17 → 1.5.18`.

## [1.5.17] - 2026-05-23

### Changed

- **Two upstream plugin bumps propagated: `academic-writing-skills`
  `0.2.0 → 0.2.1` and `research-workspace` `0.3.15 → 0.3.16`.**
  This release bundles the producer-side and consumer-side halves of a
  single cross-plugin contract fix surfaced by the 2026-05-23 Stage 7-8
  dogfood (`paper-memory-builder` → `academic-writing-skills` claim
  handoff). The two plugins ship in lockstep here because the dogfood
  identified one friction split across them; shipping either alone
  would leave the chain partial.
  - **`academic-writing-skills 0.2.1` (PR #6, `5a1cbe0` on `main`)** —
    `references/claim_evidence_audit.md` gains a `## When .paper/claims.yml
    is present (schema-aware audit, v0.2.1+)` section. Before this PR,
    the skill's `SKILL.md` description said *"use `.paper/claims.yml`
    as ground truth instead of re-reading the manuscript"*, but the
    actual workflow reference (`claim_evidence_audit.md`) had no
    mentions of any schema field. A consuming agent walking the
    reference would either re-read the manuscript (defeating the
    contract) or guess the field-to-column mapping. The new section
    maps `claims[].sentence_in_manuscript` → "Claim" column,
    `claims[].evidence_artifacts` + `figure_or_table` → "Evidence
    Source", `claims[].status` → "Certainty Allowed", and
    `claims[].risk` → "Problem"; it also documents the
    `status → certainty allowed` enum mapping and the four
    audit-driven status transitions
    (`draft ↔ supported`, `draft → gap`, `any → rejected`). The fix is
    pure additive — readers without `.paper/claims.yml` follow the
    pre-existing generic-audit workflow unchanged.
  - **`research-workspace 0.3.16` (research-hub PR #100, `d45acac` on
    `master`)** — `paper-memory-builder` documents two
    producer-side improvements that the same dogfood identified:
    - `references/yaml-schemas.md` adds a `### file: sentinel values
      (v0.3.16+)` section recording three documented sentinels for
      `figures[].file` when the figure is embedded inside the
      manuscript with no separable source file:
      `embedded-in-manuscript`, `embedded-in-supporting-information`,
      and `embedded-in-presentation`. The dogfood used the first
      sentinel for all 10 LLM-ABM manuscript figures; without
      documentation, downstream consumers would have no way to
      distinguish an honest sentinel from a typo. The section also
      states explicitly that sentinels are a documented limitation
      rather than a permanent solution, leaving room for a future
      pre-processing step that extracts embedded figures to a
      `.paper/figures/` subdirectory.
    - `SKILL.md` adds a `### Scanning the paper repo for evidence
      artifacts (v0.3.16+)` sub-section under Inputs. The previous
      Inputs list described figures and manifest files but did not
      address non-figure evidence (simulation CSVs, analysis scripts,
      drawio sources, reviewer-response artifacts) — exactly the
      artifact types that populate `claims[].evidence_artifacts` for
      a statistical claim like the LLM-ABM chi-squared test (the
      evidence is the per-agent decision log, not a figure). The
      new sub-section lists four typical artifact types with a
      concrete YAML example mirroring the dogfood C8 claim
      (CSV + script + manuscript anchor).

- **`catalog/skills.yml` `verification_notes` appended for the two
  changed skills** (`paper-memory-builder` + `academic-writing-skills`).
  `gap-to-topic` is unchanged because PRs #97–#99 made no changes to
  that skill itself; its notes still end at the v0.3.10 / v0.3.11
  history. (PR #100 in research-hub is a `paper-memory-builder` PR,
  not gap-to-topic.) Both updated skills' `verification_status` stays
  `pass`.

`source.ref` for all plugins remains `master` / `main` (no ref-pinning
introduced). Skill count remains 15. Catalog metadata version
`1.5.16 → 1.5.17`.

## [1.5.16] - 2026-05-23

### Changed

- **`research-workspace` plugin registry version `0.3.12` → `0.3.15`**
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Bundles three upstream
  `research-hub` releases:
  - **PR #97 (v0.3.12 → v0.3.13)** — SKILL.md prose tightenings from
    the v0.3.12 dogfood. `research-context-compressor` `## Outputs`
    section now shows an explicit `provenance.from_gap` example block
    (the wire was registered in the schema doc but the Output example
    didn't show it — F1). `research-design-helper` §0 explicitly
    forbids `_PRE-FILL_`-style annotations in the design_brief file
    content (chat message signals pre-fill, file content stays clean —
    F2).
  - **PR #98 (v0.3.13 → v0.3.14)** — `brief_to_docx.js` ships inside
    `skills/research-design-helper/scripts/` as the sister generator
    to `dossier_to_docx.js`. `design_brief.md` becomes shareable as a
    Word document for advisor / committee review — closes F4 from the
    v0.3.12 dogfood. Not part of the contracted Stage 3a output;
    downstream skills read the `.md`, the `.docx` is human-only.
  - **PR #99 (v0.3.14 → v0.3.15)** — codex review tightenings from
    the independent eval of the v0.3.12-v0.3.14 deliverables. C2:
    new multi-eligible `.gaps.yml` fixture exercises the §0
    "2+ candidates → ask the user" branch (was documented in
    SKILL.md, never run against a real multi-eligible fixture).
    C4: `design_brief.md` frontmatter gains optional
    `placeholder_segments: []` field so dogfood / test-fit content
    can be machine-flagged (downstream tools should refuse to gate
    research on a brief with non-empty list).

- **Codex C1 fix — `docs/examples.md` verdict-shape table.** The
  table previously claimed "each candidate gets one of three outcomes"
  but listed four rows, the fourth being `Not assessed`. Per the
  codex independent review: `Not assessed` is a *gate-cell status*
  inside the scorecard table (a gate skipped because an earlier gate
  failed), NOT a fourth candidate-level verdict. The table is now
  relabeled to make this distinction explicit: three rows for the
  three candidate verdicts (`Do not pursue` / `Worth pursuing
  conditionally` / `Worth pursuing`), and the `Not assessed` row is
  separated under a sub-heading explaining it applies to gate cells
  in the per-candidate scorecard, not the candidate-level verdict.

- **`catalog/skills.yml`** — `research-design-helper` +
  `research-context-compressor` `verification_notes` appended with
  the v0.3.13 / v0.3.14 / v0.3.15 descriptions (`gap-to-topic`
  unchanged — PRs #97–#99 made no changes to that skill itself; its
  notes still end at the v0.3.10 / v0.3.11 history). Both skills'
  `verification_status` stays `pass`.

`source.ref` unchanged (`master`). Skill count unchanged at 11.
Catalog metadata version `1.5.15` → `1.5.16`.

## [1.5.15] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **`docs/example-topic-dossier.*` published** — six-file example
  deliverable for `gap-to-topic`, matching the existing
  `docs/example-literature-review-deliverable.*` pattern:
  `.md`, `.docx`, `.bib`, `.gaps.yml`, `.zh-TW.md`, `.zh-TW.docx`.
  Copied from the dogfood at
  `~/.claude/audits/dogfood_runs/2026-05-21-gap-to-topic-llm-abm-profiles/`
  (LLM applications in water resources — Candidate 2 conditional-go).
  `docs/examples.md` gains a corresponding section. Catalog users can
  now read what the `gap-to-topic` skill emits without installing.

### Changed

- **`research-workspace` plugin registry version `0.3.10` → `0.3.12`**
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Bundles two upstream
  `research-hub` releases:
  - **PR #95 (v0.3.10 → v0.3.11)** — schema reference for
    `topic_dossier.gaps.yml` refreshed to match what the skill
    actually emits since v0.3.6 (the `--screen` fit-check) and v0.3.9
    (the 7-section reflow): now documents top-level `run_type` /
    `recall` (with full `screen` sub-block) / `pipeline`, plus
    per-gap `open_confidence` / `dead_end_evidence` /
    `borderline_reason` / `verdict` / `verdict_reason`. New
    `downstream_consumer: research-design-helper` top-level key as a
    forward-compat hook. Companion: `gap-to-topic` made discoverable
    in research-hub's own `docs/ai-research-skills.md` (it was
    invisible there since the skill shipped at v0.3.10).
  - **PR #96 (v0.3.11 → v0.3.12)** — Stage 2 → 3a → 3b handoff
    wiring. `research-design-helper` now reads
    `.research/topic_dossier.gaps.yml` as new Input #2: when a recent
    `gap-to-topic` run is present, segment 1 (RQ) is pre-filled from
    the chosen `gaps[].statement` and segment 5 (risks) from
    `open_questions[]` + the specific concern hinted by
    `gaps[].feasibility`. Segments 2–4 (mechanism / identifiability
    / validation) are never pre-filled. Candidate selection is
    verdict-aware (filters `gaps[]` to
    `verdict in {conditional-go, go}`). `design_brief.md` frontmatter
    gains optional `source` (URI-fragment pointer to the chosen gap,
    e.g. `topic_dossier.gaps.yml#G2`) and `gap_verdict` (frozen
    snapshot of `verdict` + first 60 chars of `verdict_reason`) so
    provenance is recorded. Companion fix: `research-context-compressor`
    now reads `.research/design_brief.md` as Input #2 (matching the
    `pipeline.md` contract) and copies the `source` gap-id to the
    manifest's `provenance.from_gap` field (registered in
    `docs/research-workspace-manifest.md` upstream). First cross-skill
    handoff integration test ships at
    `tests/test_handoff_gap_to_topic_design_helper.py`.

- **Catalog drift fixed — `gap-to-topic` now visible in all
  narrative docs.** Since the skill shipped (research-hub PR #93 →
  catalog `1.5.14` via ai-research-skills PR #30), `README.md`
  "All 15 skills" details block claimed
  "11 skills" but only listed 10. `docs/pipeline.md` Stage 2 table
  omitted it. `docs/img/pipeline-overview-prompt.md` Stage 2 chip set
  + 11-skill enumeration omitted it. This PR adds `gap-to-topic` to:
  - `README.md` + `README.zh-TW.md` "All 15 skills" research-hub list
  - `docs/pipeline.md` + `.zh-TW.md` Stage 2 table (and updated Stage 3a
    row to reflect the v0.3.12 `.gaps.yml` handoff)
  - `docs/img/pipeline-overview-prompt.md` Stage 2 chip set + the
    canonical 11-skill enumeration in the regen pre-conditions
  - **Hand-off action (not gating this merge):** `docs/img/pipeline-overview.png`
    and `pipeline-overview.zh-TW.png` need manual regeneration via
    ChatGPT image-gen using the updated prompt. Until that ships, the
    image is one chip behind reality.

- **`catalog/skills.yml`** — `research-design-helper` and
  `research-context-compressor` `verification_notes` appended with the
  v0.3.12 handoff description. `gap-to-topic` `verification_notes`
  appended with the v0.3.11 schema refresh description. All three
  `verification_status` stay `pass`.

`source.ref` unchanged (`master`). Skill count unchanged at 11.
Catalog metadata version `1.5.14` → `1.5.15`.

## [1.5.14] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- **`research-workspace` plugin registry version `0.3.9` → `0.3.10`**
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Mirrors upstream `research-hub`
  PR #93, which ships `dossier_to_docx.js` as a first-class artifact
  inside the `gap-to-topic` skill (`skills/gap-to-topic/scripts/`). The
  `.docx` is now a contracted deliverable, not an operator-local
  post-processing step: the script handles Markdown table-separator
  skipping (so `|---|---|` rows do not leak as literal "---" cells in
  Word), bilingual verdict-cell colour coding (light red "do not pursue"
  / "不予推進", light yellow conditional "worth pursuing … only if" /
  "值得推進 … 須其待決條件成立", light green unconditional, light grey
  "not assessed" / "未評估"), and en / zh-TW font auto-selection
  (Microsoft JhengHei when the filename matches `.zh|zh-|zh_|-tw|-cn`,
  Arial otherwise). Prereq: `npm install -g docx` (one-time global) or
  per-skill `npm install docx`. `source.ref` unchanged (`master`); skill
  count unchanged at 11. `gap-to-topic` `verification_notes` in
  `catalog/skills.yml` updated; `verification_status` stays `pass`.
  Catalog metadata version `1.5.13` → `1.5.14`.

## [1.5.13] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- **`research-workspace` plugin registry version `0.3.8` → `0.3.9`**
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Mirrors upstream `research-hub`
  PR #92, which reflowed the `gap-to-topic` dossier as a 7-section
  research-grade decision memo: Executive Summary with per-candidate
  verdict cards → Candidate Definitions → per-candidate Decision Scorecards
  → Evidence Base → Gate-by-Gate Assessment (fixed five-field skeleton) →
  Risks & Upgrade/Kill Tests → Recommended Next Steps → reproducibility-log
  Appendix A → file-list Appendix B. `source.ref` unchanged (`master`);
  skill count unchanged at 11. `gap-to-topic` `verification_notes` in
  `catalog/skills.yml` updated; `verification_status` stays `pass`.
  Catalog metadata version `1.5.12` → `1.5.13`.

## [1.5.12] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- **`research-workspace` plugin registry version `0.3.7` → `0.3.8`**
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Mirrors upstream `research-hub`
  PR #89, a section-by-section rework of the `gap-to-topic` dossier for
  researcher value: a 5-point Likert Decision scorecard, a "what it would
  contribute" claim and a minimum-validation sketch in Gate 2, design /
  scale / proposal-vs-dissertation feasibility in Gate 3, a
  conditional-recommendation framing in the decision section, and a
  method-note Appendix. `source.ref` unchanged (`master`); skill count
  unchanged at 11. `gap-to-topic` `verification_notes` in
  `catalog/skills.yml` updated; `verification_status` stays `pass`. Catalog
  metadata version `1.5.11` → `1.5.12`.

## [1.5.11] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- **`research-workspace` plugin registry version `0.3.6` → `0.3.7`**
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Mirrors upstream `research-hub`
  PR #87, which reworked the `gap-to-topic` dossier to read as a plain
  summary report — the `G1`/`G2` machine codes dropped from the document
  (kept only in `.gaps.yml`), the Decision-scorecard glyphs replaced with
  plain words, the "no-go / go" verdict jargon replaced with plain phrasing,
  and an in-document "What's in this deliverable" index added. `source.ref`
  unchanged (`master`); skill count unchanged at 11. `gap-to-topic`
  `verification_notes` in `catalog/skills.yml` updated; `verification_status`
  stays `pass`. Catalog metadata version `1.5.10` → `1.5.11`.

## [1.5.10] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- **`research-workspace` plugin registry version `0.3.5` → `0.3.6`**
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Mirrors upstream `research-hub`
  PR #86, which wired `gap-to-topic` §1 onto the new `search --screen`
  fit-check BM25 relevance gate (research-hub PR #84) — §1 step 1 now runs
  `search --adversarial --screen --json` and builds the matrix and `.bib`
  from the on-topic results only. `source.ref` unchanged (`master`); skill
  count unchanged at 11. `gap-to-topic` `verification_notes` in
  `catalog/skills.yml` updated; `verification_status` stays `pass`. Catalog
  metadata version `1.5.9` → `1.5.10`.

## [1.5.9] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- **`research-workspace` plugin registry version `0.3.2` → `0.3.5`**
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Mirrors three upstream `research-hub`
  plugin bumps that iterated the `gap-to-topic` dossier for readability:
  reader-first layout (PR #78), scannability tables incl. a Decision
  scorecard (PR #80), and evidence-strength tags plus an upgrade/kill test
  from a Codex evaluation (PR #82). `source.ref` unchanged (`master`); skill
  count unchanged at 11. `gap-to-topic` `verification_notes` in
  `catalog/skills.yml` updated to record the dossier iteration; the skill's
  `verification_status` stays `pass`. Catalog metadata version
  `1.5.8` → `1.5.9`.

## [1.5.8] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- **`research-workspace` plugin registry version `0.3.1` → `0.3.2`**
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Mirrors the upstream `research-hub`
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` bump (PR #76), which fixed a `gap-to-topic`
  §1 workflow gap — the SKILL.md named `literature-triage-matrix` as the
  default prior-art tool but no §1 step produced its matrix; §1 now has an
  explicit step that runs it. `source.ref` unchanged (`master`); skill
  count unchanged at 11. `gap-to-topic` `verification_notes` in
  `catalog/skills.yml` updated to record the fix and the end-to-end
  re-test on the corrected pipeline (topic: "LLM applications in water
  resources"). Catalog metadata version `1.5.7` → `1.5.8`.

## [1.5.7] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- **`gap-to-topic` verification status `not_yet` → `pass`, tier `T3` → `T1`**
  (`catalog/skills.yml`). The skill was dogfood-verified end-to-end on
  2026-05-21: a run on the topic "LLM-generated agent profiles in
  agent-based models" produced a complete five-section `topic_dossier.md`
  plus `.bib` and `.gaps.yml` companions matching the dossier template.
  The run surfaced one Gate 1 bug — the `.bib` instruction relied on
  `cite`, which resolves only already-ingested Zotero items — fixed
  upstream in research-hub plugin v0.3.1. YAML-side verification counts
  are now 15 pass + 0 caveat + 0 not_yet (`test_catalog.py` updated).
- **`research-workspace` plugin registry version `0.3.0` → `0.3.1`**
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Mirrors the upstream `research-hub`
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` bump (PR #75) that fixed the `gap-to-topic`
  Gate 1 `.bib` instruction. `source.ref` unchanged (`master`); skill
  count unchanged at 11. Catalog metadata version `1.5.6` → `1.5.7`.

## [1.5.6] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- **`research-workspace` plugin registry version `0.2.0` → `0.3.0`**
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Mirrors the upstream `research-hub`
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` bump — research-hub added an 11th packaged
  skill, `gap-to-topic` (a topic-decision dossier that runs a candidate
  research topic through a 3-gate go/no-go test). The registry entry now
  matches the upstream `0.3.0`, so a
  `claude plugin update research-workspace@ai-research-skills` pulls a
  fresh cache that includes the new skill. `source.ref` unchanged
  (`master`); the plugin description is updated 10 → 11 skills.

## [1.5.5] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **`docs/example-literature-review-deliverable.md` (+ `.zh-TW.md`,
  `.docx`, `.zh-TW.docx`, `.bib`, `.gaps.yml`) — a full
  literature-review deliverable example.** The per-skill entries in
  `docs/examples.md` show output *fragments*; this new file shows the
  consolidated 9-section document the research-hub literature pipeline
  (`search` → `literature-triage-matrix` → `research-design-helper`)
  produces end to end — literature inventory, per-paper summaries,
  cross-paper
  synthesis, tagged research-gap analysis, recommended next step,
  references, and a provenance section. Doubles as a reusable
  section-contract template. Fully synthetic (6 fabricated papers,
  placeholder identifiers) per the catalog's no-real-artifacts policy.
  Markdown + Word, English + 繁中. Ships machine-readable companions
  too — a BibTeX `.bib` (references) and a `.gaps.yml` (structured
  research gaps + open questions). `docs/examples.md` and `.zh-TW.md`
  gain a "Putting it together" pointer section.

## [1.5.4] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- **`academic-writing-skills` plugin registry version `0.1.0` → `0.2.0`**
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Mirrors the upstream
  `academic-writing-skills` `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` bump
  (Phase 8.1). A 2026-05-21 Phase 9 behavioral verification found the
  `§8 step 10` claim-gap cross-reference (added in the prior
  `academic-writing-skills` release) had shipped to that repo's `main`
  but not to user installs — the plugin cache directory is keyed on
  the version string, and the prior change never bumped it. The
  registry entry now matches the upstream `0.2.0` so a
  `claude plugin update academic-writing-skills@ai-research-skills`
  pulls a fresh cache. `source.ref` unchanged (`main`).

## [1.5.3] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- **`research-workspace` plugin registry version `0.1.0` → `0.2.0`**
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). Mirrors the upstream
  `research-hub` `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` bump (Phase 8 Wave 1).
  A 2026-05-20 dogfood test found fresh `claude plugin install` users
  were still served the pre-Phase-7 cached `0.1.0` skill bundle — the
  `paper-memory-builder` anti-leakage rule (Phase 7 Wave A) and the
  `zotero-skills` shadow removal (Wave C) had shipped to the
  `research-hub` `master` branch but not propagated to installs,
  because the plugin cache directory is keyed on this version string.
  The registry entry now matches the upstream `0.2.0` so a
  `claude plugin marketplace update` pulls a fresh cache. The plugin
  `source.ref` is unchanged (`master`); only the version label moves.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- **Standalone-skills callout in `README.md` + `README.zh-TW.md`** at
  the top of the `## Install` section: explicit list of the 7 of 14
  skills that work immediately with only Claude Code (no Python /
  Zotero / Codex / Gemini CLI setup) — the 6 manifest / triage /
  design skills inside `research-workspace`
  (`literature-triage-matrix`, `research-design-helper`,
  `research-context-compressor`, `research-project-orienter`,
  `paper-memory-builder`, `research-hub-multi-ai`) plus
  `academic-writing-skills`. Closes the "如果其他人只有 Claude
  怎麼辦" question raised during the Phase 5.3.b verification dogfood.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **README badges rendered as literal markdown text instead of shield
  images.** The Phase 6 PR-2 (`v1.5.0`) "badge clutter" cleanup wrapped
  the three badges in `<sub>...</sub>` for smaller font, but per
  CommonMark / GFM rules a multi-line markdown block inside an HTML
  block tag (with no blank line separator) is not processed as
  markdown — so the three badges shipped as literal
  `[![License](...)](LICENSE)` text on GitHub's renderer. Replaced
  the markdown image syntax with equivalent pure-HTML
  `<a><img></a>` inside the same `<sub>` wrapper, on a single line.
  Now the badges render correctly as 3 small shields linking to
  `LICENSE` and `.research/hermes-compatibility-audit.md`. Same fix
  applied to `README.zh-TW.md`. No behavior change beyond the visual
  fix; the link targets are unchanged.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

The usability content that the Phase 6 agent-team analysis flagged as
the highest-impact missing pieces. PR-1 (`1.4.3`) shipped only bug
fixes; this minor release adds net-new docs.

- **`docs/verification.md` + `docs/verification.zh-TW.md` § 2026-05-20 Phase 6 post-merge re-verification on v1.5.0** — captures the install round-trip + 14-skill auto-trigger + three dogfood walks re-run against the v1.5.0 (`1b557fc`) HEAD. Phase A passes (5 / 5 ✔ enabled). Phase B strict count 10 / 14 (lenient 13 / 14, one routing overlap with `agent-collab-workspace:agent-task-splitter`, three conservative input-first responses). Phase C three ⚠ partial walks, all gaps roll into the existing Phase 2 hard-gated research-hub backlog. (Originally landed in PR #15 on top of `v1.5.0`; recorded here under the version it actually exercised.)

- **`docs/examples.md`** + **`docs/examples.zh-TW.md`** — synthetic
  deliverable samples for the 4 most-common skills
  (`literature-triage-matrix`: 5-paper × 9-column matrix;
  `academic-writing-skills`: banned-word audit table + reviewer-response
  table; `zotero-library-curator`: preview-only audit report; 
  `paper-summarize`: per-paper Key Findings / Methodology / Relevance
  markdown block). Closes the dogfood-report finding that fresh users
  install on faith without ever seeing what each skill produces.
- **`docs/glossary.md`** + **`docs/glossary.zh-TW.md`** — defines the
  catalog-specific terms used across the docs (plugin vs skill, bare
  name vs qualified name, `.research/` and `.paper/` conventions,
  Obsidian cluster, NotebookLM brief, `research-hub auto`, T1/T2/T3
  verification tiers, skill router, marketplace cache vs
  `~/.claude/skills/`, stage 1–8 phase numbers used in the skill list).
  Closes the dogfood-report finding that 4 of those terms were used
  without definition.
- **README.md + README.zh-TW.md — "Time + cost expectations" table**:
  maintainer-observed wall-time + conversation-turn ranges for the 5
  most common tasks (compare 5 papers, banned-word audit, reviewer
  response, Zotero audit, summarize 5 papers). Closes the dogfood
  finding that the docs gave no time/cost signal.
- **README.md + README.zh-TW.md — Zotero backup callout**: explicit
  "⚠️ Back up before any Zotero CRUD" block before any path that lets
  `zotero-skills` write. Closes the dogfood finding that 800-item
  library cleanup had no backup warning.
- **README.md + README.zh-TW.md — cross-links**: new top-of-page links
  to `docs/examples` and `docs/glossary`; new pointer to
  `docs/pipeline.md` + `docs/glossary.md`'s "Phase numbers" section
  from the All-14-skills section, so the dangling `*(Stages X, Y)*`
  tags now resolve.
- **`docs/install.md` + `docs/install.zh-TW.md` "Worked invocation
  examples"**: concrete recipes for `codex exec`, `gemini`, and Cursor
  rules-dir layout. Closes the per-host F3 gap (mechanism table was
  present in 1.4.x but no concrete invocation snippets).

### Changed

- **`docs/verification.md` + `docs/verification.zh-TW.md` — zotero-skills
  shadow collision workaround section rewritten** in plain language
  with a concrete `Skill(skill="zotero-skills:zotero-skills")` worked
  example and a clear explanation of when to use the qualified form
  vs the bare form. The 1.4.x version was honest but used too much
  jargon — fresh users could not act on it. (Underlying collision
  remains; the real fix is still Phase 2-gated.)
- **README.md + README.zh-TW.md — badge placement**: the 3 compatibility
  badges (MIT, agentskills.io, Hermes verified) moved from above the
  tagline into a `<sub>` block below the language selector. The
  promotional-feel-at-the-top issue flagged by the dogfood report;
  badges still verifiable, just less prominent.

### Out of scope for this release (Phase 2 hard-gated, unchanged)

- SKILL.md `description` rewrites in `WenyuChiou/research-hub` for
  auto-trigger keyword overlap (research-hub, paper-memory-builder,
  research-design-helper, notebooklm-brief-verifier,
  zotero-library-curator).
- Delete `research-hub/skills/zotero-skills/` to resolve the bare-name
  shadow collision at the source.
- Align `research-hub/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to declare all 10
  shipped skills.
- v0.3 backlog: cross-model independent judge, corpus-scale FNR/FPR
  calibration, domain generalisation beyond water-resources / ABM.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

Stale-fact + install-path-consistency sweep driven by the Phase 6 agent-team
analysis (Explore + code-reviewer + fresh-user dogfood). All findings of the
"would actually break a new user's experience" class — no new content,
no schema changes. The matching usability *additions* ship in [1.5.0].

- **Verify-step bug across 4 user-entry-point docs** (6 distinct
  occurrences total): `README.md`, `README.zh-TW.md`,
  `docs/setup-guide.md` (3 locations: Phase B1, B-extra, C3),
  `docs/setup-guide.zh-TW.md` (same 3 locations) all instructed
  `ls ~/.claude/skills/<name>` after `claude plugin install`, but
  marketplace plugins do **not** extract there — they live under
  `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/skills/<name>/`.
  A new user running the prior verify command saw an empty directory
  and concluded the install failed. Replaced every occurrence with
  `claude plugin list` + an inline explanation. (The Phase 5.3.b
  addendum had documented this correctly in `docs/verification.md` but
  the fix never propagated to the user-entry-point docs.)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: `# 11 tests, < 1s` → `# 25 tests, < 1s` (test count
  was stale since the schema layer landed in 1.4.0).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: research-hub upstream description "9 skills" →
  "10 skills" (every other doc in the repo had already said 10;
  CONTRIBUTING.md was the lone holdout).
- `docs/skill-directory.zh-TW.md`: added the `paper-summarize` row that
  was present in the EN counterpart but missing in zh-TW, so 繁中 readers
  could not discover the skill from the directory.
- `docs/install.md` + `docs/install.zh-TW.md`: "9 skills under
  `~/.claude/skills/`" → "10 skills"; updated the enumeration to include
  `paper-summarize`.
- `docs/install.md` + `docs/install.zh-TW.md`: rewrote the
  `knowledge-base` deprecation note from "slated for removal in
  research-hub-pipeline v0.70" (future tense) to a past-tense
  observation that v0.70+ has dropped the alias — the prior wording was
  stale relative to current research-hub releases.
- `docs/install.md` §2–§5: relabeled the canonical install path for
  each of `academic-writing-skills` / `zotero-skills` / `codex-delegate`
  / `gemini-delegate` to `claude plugin install …@ai-research-skills`,
  collapsed the bare `git clone … ~/.claude/skills/<name>` blocks into
  `<details>` "Legacy alternative" sections. README and `install.md`
  now agree on which install path is canonical.
- `docs/setup-guide.md` + `docs/setup-guide.zh-TW.md` (Phase D verify):
  expected version `0.7x or higher` → `0.45.0 or higher` to match the
  baseline documented in `docs/verification.md`.
- `docs/setup-guide.md` + `docs/setup-guide.zh-TW.md` (Phase E3):
  added Node.js 18+ prerequisite before the `npm install -g` commands
  (Python-only environments hit `npm: command not found` with no
  diagnostic path); fixed the Codex CLI link from
  `WenyuChiou/codex-delegate#readme` (the skill wrapper) to
  `github.com/openai/codex` (the actual upstream CLI), same for the
  Gemini CLI link.

### Out of scope for this release

These came up in the Phase 6 analysis but cannot ship in 1.4.3 because
they require changes to the `WenyuChiou/research-hub` source repo,
which is Phase-2 hard-gated:

- SKILL.md `description` rewrites for `research-hub`, `paper-memory-builder`,
  `research-design-helper`, `notebooklm-brief-verifier`, `zotero-library-curator`
  to improve auto-trigger keyword overlap.
- Removing the embedded `research-hub/skills/zotero-skills/` copy to
  resolve the bare-name shadow collision documented in `docs/verification.md`
  §2026-05-20.
- Aligning `research-hub/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to declare all 10
  shipped skills (currently declares 3).

## [1.4.2] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- [`docs/verification.md`](docs/verification.md) +
  [`docs/verification.zh-TW.md`](docs/verification.zh-TW.md) — Phase
  5.3.b end-to-end addendum: real `claude plugin marketplace add` →
  `install-all.sh` → bare-name skill resolution chain exercised on a
  clean Claude Code 2.1.142 machine. All 14 expected skill names
  resolve; trigger-routing prompts hit 14/14 (one resolution lands on
  the wrong copy of `zotero-skills` — see collision note in the
  addendum). Provides the first documented evidence for the
  "no install round-trip is asserted by CI" gap that the README
  Limitations section called out. CI still does not assert this path
  — only manual evidence now exists.
- [`README.md`](README.md) + [`README.zh-TW.md`](README.zh-TW.md)
  Limitations — documented the silent `zotero-skills` name collision
  (`research-workspace` embeds an old copy that shadows the canonical
  standalone via bare-name invocation), with the
  `Skill(skill="zotero-skills:zotero-skills")` workaround for users
  who need the canonical standalone variant. Upstream fix is deferred
  to Phase 2 (research-hub source edit).

### Changed

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — `research-workspace`
  description now enumerates all 10 listed research-hub skills (the
  previous text listed 9 items for a stated count of 10 — the
  `project orientation` item for `research-project-orienter` was
  missing). No behavioural change; documentation polish to match the
  stated count.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` `metadata.version`: `1.4.1 → 1.4.2`.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-20

### Removed

- `docs/public-post-outline.md` — was launch-marketing material, no
  longer needed after the marketplace shipped.
- `docs/repo-map.md` + `docs/repo-map.zh-TW.md` — content duplicated
  by `CONTRIBUTING.md` §"Where the change belongs" and
  `docs/skill-directory.md`.

### Changed

- `docs/index.html` — removed the "Repo map" link card.

- [`WenyuChiou/academic-writing-skills`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/academic-writing-skills)
  — added `CHANGELOG.md`, `.github/workflows/test.yml` (first CI),
  and fixed a latent test path bug (silent since the 2026-04-26
  marketplace migration). Tagged
  [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/academic-writing-skills/releases/tag/v0.1.0).
- [`WenyuChiou/zotero-skills`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/zotero-skills)
  — added MIT `LICENSE` (was previously legally ambiguous despite
  README's `## License: MIT` declaration); added `CHANGELOG.md`;
  tagged
  [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/zotero-skills/releases/tag/v0.1.0).
- [`WenyuChiou/codex-delegate`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/codex-delegate)
  — added `CHANGELOG.md`; tagged
  [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/codex-delegate/releases/tag/v0.1.0).
- [`WenyuChiou/gemini-delegate-skill`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/gemini-delegate-skill)
  — added `CHANGELOG.md`; tagged
  [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/gemini-delegate-skill/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

Pinning `marketplace.json` plugin `ref` to `v0.1.0` is deferred — see
`docs/design-philosophy.md` §Roadmap.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- `schema/skills.schema.json` — JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12) formalising
  the shape of `catalog/skills.yml`. Every field, every URL pattern,
  every enum is now machine-checked.
- `scripts/check_catalog_schema.py` — CI-runnable validator that loads
  the YAML, validates against the schema, and prints JSON-pointer-style
  error paths on failure.
- `tests/test_catalog_schema.py` — 14 pytest cases: 1 positive (live
  catalog validates), 1 meta (schema itself is valid Draft 2020-12),
  12 negative (ad-hoc mutations are correctly rejected — guards the
  schema from being silently weakened).
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) — reconstructed from PR history.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — installs `jsonschema` and runs
  `python scripts/check_catalog_schema.py` as a CI step alongside the
  existing pytest + consistency check.

### Changed

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` `metadata.version`: `1.3.0 → 1.4.0`.
- `docs/design-philosophy.md` + `.zh-TW.md` — "JSON schema for
  catalog/skills.yml is on the roadmap" moved from the Roadmap section
  into the **What the catalog machine-checks** list, now that it ships.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-19

### Removed

- `audit-first-skills` sibling plugin (PR
  [#9](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/ai-research-skills/pull/9)).
  Was briefly registered in `1.2.0` earlier the same day; the scope
  was a misread — the sibling repo (`WenyuChiou/audit-first-skills`)
  was deleted and the catalog reverted to 5 plugins.
- `docs/why-not-ARS.md`, `docs/audit-first-design.md` — both specific
  to the deleted sibling.
- `docs/demo-walkthrough.md` + `.zh-TW.md` — out of scope for the
  curated-catalog framing; `docs/pipeline.md` + `docs/skill-directory.md`
  are the user-facing entry points.
- `templates/test_skill_integrity.template.py` — no consumer remains
  after the sibling deletion.

### Added

- `docs/design-philosophy.md` + `.zh-TW.md` — bilingual honest design
  contract: what the catalog is, what it machine-checks, what it does
  not, what's borrowed from ARS (shape, not scale), Roadmap.
- `README.md` + `README.zh-TW.md`: `## Limitations` / `## 限制`
  sections with concrete honest scope statements (one researcher;
  water-resources / ABM domain bias; no CI-asserted install round-trip).

### Fixed

- `.claude-plugin/README.md` `research-workspace` skill count `9 → 10`
  (the `paper-summarize` skill was missing from the enumeration; a
  pre-existing off-by-one surfaced by the cleanup pass).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-19  *(reverted same day in 1.3.0)*

### Added

- `audit-first-skills` sibling plugin registered via PR
  [#8](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/ai-research-skills/pull/8). A
  5-skill bundle (verify-references, senior-author-review,
  abstract-writer, scientific-writing, skill-lint) sourced from
  `WenyuChiou/audit-first-skills`.

> ⚠️ **Reverted in 1.3.0 (same day, ~2h later).** The user's intent
> was to mature `ai-research-skills` itself, not spin off a sibling
> repo. If you installed during the ~2-hour window the sibling was
> registered, run `claude plugin update` to refresh.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- `scripts/check_marketplace_consistency.py` — CI script that verifies
  `catalog/skills.yml` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` agree on
  plugin order, repo URLs, and skill counts.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — CI runs `pytest tests/ -q` and the
  new consistency script on every push / PR to `main`.

### Changed

- `codex-delegate` verification tier `T2 → T1` after upstream PR
  [`WenyuChiou/codex-delegate#1`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/codex-delegate/pull/1)
  documented the `-m gpt-5.4` workaround + stdin-close requirement.
- `paper-summarize` verification tier `T2 → T1` after upstream PR
  [`WenyuChiou/research-hub#31`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/research-hub/pull/31)
  surfaced the existing 23-test end-to-end suite in the skill's own
  Verification section.
- `research-hub-multi-ai` role repositioned (still T1) as the **router**
  in a router/leaves architecture via upstream PR
  [`WenyuChiou/research-hub#30`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/research-hub/pull/30);
  triggers only when ≥2 delegates are needed in the same round.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- Initial public Claude Code plugin marketplace at
  `WenyuChiou/ai-research-skills` with 5 plugins:
  - `research-workspace` — 10 skills auto-discovered from
    `WenyuChiou/research-hub`.
  - `academic-writing-skills`.
  - `zotero-skills`.
  - `codex-delegate`.
  - `gemini-delegate` (source: `WenyuChiou/gemini-delegate-skill`).
- 14 SKILL.md files across the 5 plugins.
- `catalog/skills.yml` — machine-readable catalog.
- Bilingual entry-point docs: `README.md` + `README.zh-TW.md`,
  `docs/install.md` + `.zh-TW.md`, `docs/verification.md` + `.zh-TW.md`,
  `docs/pipeline.md` + `.zh-TW.md`, `docs/researcher-workflow-checklist.md`
  + `.zh-TW.md`, `docs/skill-directory.md` + `.zh-TW.md`.
- `scripts/install-all.sh` + `install-all.ps1` batch installers.
- `tests/test_catalog.py` — structural pytest covering catalog YAML,
  marketplace JSON, README phrase invariants, persona table, verification
  counts.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — Claude Code marketplace registry.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — coordination rules for source-dir renames,
  skill-output contracts, marketplace ↔ source repo plugin-name
  matching, default-branch ↔ marketplace `ref` matching.
- `LICENSE` — MIT.
